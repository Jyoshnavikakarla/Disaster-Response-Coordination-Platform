      <h1>About Disaster Response Coordination Platform</h1>
      <p>
        The <strong>Disaster Response Coordination Platform (DRCP)</strong> is a web-based solution 
        designed to bridge the gap between victims, volunteers, and authorities during disaster situations.

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>

      <p>
